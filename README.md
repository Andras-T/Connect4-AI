# Connect4-AI
 - > Connect 4 is a classic two-player strategy game that is played on a vertical board consisting of seven columns and six rows. The game is won by being the first player to connect four of their own colored disks in a row, whether it be horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
 The players take turns dropping their colored disks into the columns, and the disks will stack up from the bottom of the board. Players must strategically place their disks to block their opponent's progress while simultaneously working towards their own goal of connecting four. The game ends either when one player successfully connects four disks, or when the board becomes completely filled without either player winning.
 Connect 4 is a fast-paced game that requires both critical thinking and quick decision-making. It is suitable for players of all ages and skill levels and is often played in schools, homes, and even professional tournaments.

  - > This Connect 4 project was made in Java involving AI is an implementation of the classic game with an added twist. In this version of the game, the computer player uses minimax algorithm to make strategic moves against the human player. The algorithm evaluates the game board and assigns a score to each possible move based on its likelihood of winning. The AI then selects the move with the highest score, ensuring that it makes the best possible move to try and win the game.
